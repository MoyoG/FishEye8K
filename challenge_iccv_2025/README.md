# 🐳 Docker Setup for AI City ICCV 2025 Track 4

This guide provides a quick start tutorial for container submissions using a fine-tuned YOLOv11n model as a reference.

# Evaluation Container Submission Guide

## 🔹 Pull the Prebuilt Docker Image

Start by pulling the prebuilt Docker image designed for Jetson devices:

```bash
docker pull ganzobtn/aicity_iccv_2025_track4_jetson:latest
```
## 🔹 Build Image Locally (Optional)
If you'd prefer to build the Docker image locally:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.jetson -t ganzobtn/aicity_iccv_2025_track4_jetson:latest .
```

## 🔹 Run the Docker container

```bash
IMAGE="ganzobtn/aicity_iccv_2025_track4_jetson:latest"
DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/data"
```

```bash
docker run -it --ipc=host --runtime=nvidia -v ${DATA_DIR}:/data ${IMAGE}
```

📁 Expected Directory Structure

The `run_evaluation_jetson.py` script inside the container expects the following structure:

- `/data/FishEye1K_eval/` Contains the groundtruth.json file, evaluation images and corresponding annotation files.

- `models/yolo11n_fisheye8k.pt`  
  The fine-tuned YOLOv11n model file used for inference.
  
**You should develop your own implementations of the get_model, preprocess_image, and postprocess_results functions in utils.py for your submission.**


# Training Container Guide

This section provides a getting started guide for setting up and running the training Docker container for the challenge, which uses a YOLOv11n model finetuning pipeline.

## 🔹 Pull Prebuilt Docker Image 

You can use the prebuilt Docker image available on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull ganzobtn/aicity_iccv_2025_track4_train:latest
```
---

## 🔹 Build the Docker Image Locally (Optional)
If you'd prefer to build the image from the provided Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.train -t ganzobtn/aicity_iccv_2025_track4_train:latest .
```

## 🔹 Run the Docker Container
Set your local paths and run the container:

```bash
IMAGE="ganzobtn/aicity_iccv_2025_track4_train:latest"

DATA_DIR="/path/to/your/data"
MODEL_DIR="/path/to/your/models"

docker run -it --ipc=host --runtime=nvidia \
  -v ${DATA_DIR}:/data \
  -v ${MODEL_DIR}:/models \
  ${IMAGE}
```

📁 Expected Directory Structure
 run_train_yolo.py script inside the container expects the following structure:

 - A dataset folder named Fisheye8K located inside /data.

 - Trained models and output logs will be saved to /models.
